# Find that Employee ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)

## Description

This is a React app that will allow an employer to easily find an employee's contact information. Columns can be sorted in ascending or descending order and a search field allows for quick searching. I set it up to populate using a random user api to show what it would look like for a larger company. See the demo version here: <https://melindawinter.github.io/employee-directory/>
